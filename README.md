Sphinx_Protocol - a DAG that is a Sybil-resistant quantum immune centralized asynchronous system with fast transaction confirmations (time to finality) & Byzantine fault tolerance which is also the foundation for a Security Token Offering. Built using post quantum cryptography modifcations to the fantom foundation DAG it allows users to pay for Quantum computing resources, use GPU accelorators for High Performance computing and to transfer customized access to quantum applications built by data science professionals on the anubis cloud platform. Using Personium, An interconnectable open source PDS (Personal Data Store) Users are able to design customized quantum applications, save code edits & then set permissions to give access to users to launch the application natively through anubis cloud.  Papyras is the name of the ledger,Scarabs are used in the consensus. Glyphs are the Dapps launched on the network.
